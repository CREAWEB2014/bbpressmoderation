1.9.0 - 3rd Jan 2017 - by Florian Höch
		Changed 'Always display' option to 'Display for moderators and original author': If enabled, pending topics/replies are visible in the frontend to the original author and users with moderation privileges (but nobody else), and if disabled, pending topics/replies will only be visible in the backend.
		Added 'Display pending posts on widgets' option which tries to target widgets separate from forums (a bit hacky, so may not always work as intended, but should work for the default bbPress recent topics and replies widgets)
		Added 'Approve' link for pending topics and replies (backend and frontend)
		Only tested with WordPress 4.7 and PHP 7, so buckle up!
